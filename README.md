# FetchGitCommits

# I have created this project as per the requirements.

# This project is used to fetch most recent commits from the GitHub API.

# It has features like...

# Pull to Refresh commits list.

# It supports both Light Mode and Dark Mode, it depends on system's mode.

# In this project I have fixed Its own Repository so it is helpful to track my work flow.

# Also I have done some unit testing using Jest as per the requirement.

# Thank you
